Hi,

This zip file contains:

    tree_data.py - contains the solution to the Candidate Evaluation Assignment
    
    Usage:
        python tree_data.py [-h] [-f FILE]
        python tree_data.py : This runs the default, using the data.txt file, you can substitute another
            file the -f option
        
This was run on the Python that I have on my home Windows PC (2.7.10)

Thanks, I hope to get feedback from you soon.

Regards,
Tom DiFilippo
